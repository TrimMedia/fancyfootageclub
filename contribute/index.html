				<p>	
					Your clips will never get lost in a sea of content. We host the best and only the best. So if someone is looking for a loop of coffee brewing, they know they can find the best loop of coffee brewing (your loop of coffee brewing).

				<h2 class="white">You Are Always Promoted</h2>
				<p>	
					We never separate your content from your name. Financial and creative fulfillment are only one part of the equation. Most stock footage sites are insular — footage by filmmakers, for filmmakers. Fancy Footage Club places your work directly in front of engaged, professional designers.

				<p>	
					We are the only site that will pay you for your stock footage now. Have some old footage lying around that you think is stellar? Make it loop, kick it our way, and get a few extra bucks towards that lens you know you want.

				<h2>We're Focused On Community</h2>
				<p>	
					We are a tight-knit community of filmmakers and designers. Our goal is simple: to promote better creative work. For the designers, that involves finding the best footage, and for you that means fair compensation and promotion so you can keep doing what you love.
