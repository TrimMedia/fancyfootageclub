- q: 'When are new loops added?'
  a: 'Collections are emailed on the first Tuesday of every month. The website updates that day too. You can follow us on social media for a quick ping when new footage becomes available.'

- q: 'I’m having trouble using these loops on my site. Any suggestions?'
  a: 'There’s a great guide from Florent Verschelde that lays video implementation out nicely: <a href="http://fvsch.com/code/video-background/">http://fvsch.com/code/video-background/</a>'

- q: 'How can I get past month’s loops?'
  a: 'Our current agreement with our contributors only allows us to offer their footage free for one month. We are working hard behind the scenes to expanding those agreements to allow us to host older footage in a library. Keep an eye on our emails and social media for updates.'

- q: 'I have some footage I really think people would love! Can it be featured in one of your collections?'
  a: 'Our footage is curated, meaning that we do not accept every clip that is submitted to us. We would love to see what you’re working with though! Send it our way through the <a href="/contribute">contributor page.</a>'
